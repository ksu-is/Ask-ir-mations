# Ask-ir-mations
This software will ask users to type in an adjective of how they feel and then the system will give them a positive affirmation that relates to their input.
This software is directed to anybody who needs a little pick me up throughout the day or just a reminder of the light at the end of the tunnel. These days we are constantly on the move and that can cause us to quickly lose our sense of self and our peace of mind. My dream is to provide something to remind people of the good things in life despite their current emotions or hardships. My software will ask users to type in an adjective of how they feel and then the system will give them a positive affirmation that relates to their input. That’s how we got our name “Ask-ir-mations” Our users ask for affirmations. There will also be an affirmation of the day which is a great way to set the tone for the day ahead. Our users are able to gain an immediate boost in morale and overall happiness. It's also easily accessible so whenever our users need us, we're always there. Ask-ir-mations is here no matter the time, place, or occasion with just the right words to ease your mind. So, say goodbye to negativity and hello to the positive power of Ask-ir-mations.
This project will be done by 1 person.
